# AutomatedTesting

Simple testing program for c++ files. After you've inputted tests and right answers for them, you need to press just one button to retest.

Things to know:
1. Uses g++, so chech if it is installed with 'g++ --version'.
2. The main method in your c++ file should start with 'int main(', without any additional words between those. Spaces are allowed:)
   For example, "int main(){", 
                 "    int  main(int argc,  char     \*argv[]) {",
                 " int main () {" 
                 is ok, but "int lol main()" is not.
